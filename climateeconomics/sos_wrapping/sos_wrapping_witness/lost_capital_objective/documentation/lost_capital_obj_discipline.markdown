## Lost capital objective

This model gathers all capital lost by investment for various reasons : 
- non use of an energy industry because of lack of raw materials (needed energy or resources)
- a wrong combination of opponent technologies (i.e. reforestation and deforestation) 
- later non use of any sectorized industry because lack of workforce or energy

The model computes then a capital lost objective to minimize the sum of all lost capitals : 


$$ lost_capital_objective = \sum(lost_capital)/ref $$

with a reference defined in input parameters.
