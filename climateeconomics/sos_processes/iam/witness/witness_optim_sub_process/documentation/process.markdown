# WITNESS documentation

Witness is a multidisciplinary analysis which puts into interaction different disciplines. The following parts describe shortly the different disciplines. More detailed can be found in the documentation of each discipline.

## Resources
Producing energy consume resources, such as gas, coal, uranium...
Resources discipline aims to follow the evolution of stock and resources, extraction prices, and assure that stock are not infinite.

## Energy demand
This discipline follows the demand of each energy considered

## Macroeconomics
This discipline represents the global wealth production. It permits to link the evolution of energy production and the impact on global economy, through GDP and other parameters.

## Carbon cycle
Carbon cycle determines the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere and oceans.

## Carbon emissions
This compute the total CO2 emissions from different fields.

## Damage
This model estimates the economics damage done by CO2 emission and pollution.

## Temperature change
This model computes the evolution of the average temperature of atmosphere and ocean, as a consequences of the CO2 emissions.

## Policy
This models adjusts CO2 tax to guide energy investment to a zero emission energy.

## Energy model
This groups different sub model that computes the energy produced, CO2 emitted, resources consumed by each technologies, and groups it at energy level, based on investment.

## CCUS
This groups different sub model that compute the CO2 captured and stored, based on investment. 

## Land use
This compute the space needed for agriculture and some energy way of production (solar panel for example) and assure that this does not exceed the earth surface.

## Utility
This computes the global wealth of the population, that results of all the model shortly describes previously.


Witness process aims to predict the energy produced based on a certain split of investment in the energy field. It also predicts consequences such as carbon emissions, damage on environment, land use impact, population impact and temperature change.
